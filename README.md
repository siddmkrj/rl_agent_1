# RL Agent 1

## 0️⃣ What Are We Solving? (Brief, Precise)

### Problem Statement

## Step 1: Cube Pick and Place

Build a reinforcement learning agent using PyBullet simulation and TensorFlow to train a robot to perform a pick-and-place task.

### Environment Setup
- **Simulation**: PyBullet
- **Framework**: TensorFlow
- **Components**:
  - A simple robot (manipulator)
  - A cube (object to be manipulated)
  - A basket (target location)

### Objective
Train the robot to:
1. Grab the cube
2. Place it in the basket
